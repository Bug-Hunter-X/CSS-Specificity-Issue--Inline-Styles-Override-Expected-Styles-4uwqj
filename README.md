# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to specificity and unexpected behavior when inline styles clash with other selectors.  Inline styles take precedence over other styles, even if those styles seem more specific.

The `bug.css` file shows the issue. The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution to avoid these issues.

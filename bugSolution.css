To avoid this problem, it's crucial to follow best practices:

1. **Avoid inline styles whenever possible.**  Inline styles are generally a bad practice. If you have styles that need to be applied, use internal or external stylesheets instead.
2. **Understand CSS Specificity.** Ensure you are aware of how specificity works in CSS. If you are unsure, try using a CSS specificity calculator online.
3. **Be Consistent.** Use a consistent naming convention for your classes and IDs to make it easier to track which styles are taking precedence.
4. **Use !important (With Caution).** The `!important` rule can override any other styles, but it should be used very sparingly. Overusing `!important` can lead to more difficult debugging later.

.myClass {
  font-weight: bold;
}

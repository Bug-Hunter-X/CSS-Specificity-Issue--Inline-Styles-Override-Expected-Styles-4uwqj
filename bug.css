The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling behavior.  For example, if you have an inline style that conflicts with an ID selector and a class selector, the inline style will take precedence, even if the ID selector is more specific according to standard CSS rules.  This is often confusing for developers who don't fully grasp the cascading order of CSS.
